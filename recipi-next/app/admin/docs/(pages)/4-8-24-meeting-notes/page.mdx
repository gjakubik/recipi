# Meeting Memo: Enhancing Ingredient Management in Recipi

### Overview

During our recent discussion, we focused on strategies to enhance the
normalization of ingredient usage within Recipi. Our primary objective is to
establish a master list of ingredients that ensures consistency and accuracy
across the platform. This memo outlines the key points discussed and the actions
we intend to take.

### Master Ingredient List Development

**Objective**: Create a centralized master list of ingredients to normalize
usage across all recipes.

- **Moderation Process**:

  - It was agreed that there needs to be a moderation mechanism to ensure the
    quality and relevance of ingredients added to the master list.
  - **Action Item**: Research and decide on a moderation process.

- **Minimum Quota for Inclusion**:

  - Ingredients will only be added to the master list once they hit a certain
    usage threshold (x instances).
  - **Action Item**: Determine the exact quota for ingredient inclusion.

- **Enhanced Ingredient Data**:

  - Beyond the ingredient name, we aim to include additional information such as
    calorie data.
  - **Action Item**: Explore methods for aggregating nutritional information for
    each ingredient.

- **Metric Use**:

  - Implementation of a backend metric to assist in the moderation and inclusion
    process.
  - **Action Item**: Further discussion needed on specific metrics and
    implementation strategies.

- **AI Moderation Consideration**:
  - The possibility of using AI for ingredient moderation was discussed, though
    concerns about cost were raised.
  - **Action Item**: Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of AI moderation.

### Additional Features and Considerations

- **Calorie Count Feature**:

  - Introduction of an opt-in calorie count at both the recipe and user level.
  - **Action Item**: Develop UI/UX design for calorie count feature, ensuring it
    is intuitive and user-friendly.

- **Substitution Recommendations**:
  - Implement AI or graph algorithm-based substitution recommendations,
    acknowledging that some margin of error is acceptable.
  - **Action Item**: Research and prototype substitution recommendation
    algorithms.

### Unknowns

- The scalability of the `knownIngredients` list is a point of concern.
  - **Action Item**: Conduct analysis on expected growth and scalability
    challenges of the ingredient list.
