# DB Schema change strategy

TLDR: ALTER statements are not supported in Planetscale. We need to add a new
column, run some script/code to populate that column based on the old one, and
then deploy a new schema change deleting the old column. This will maintain all
the data and keep it conformed to the schema.

Check this page:
[Planetscale Docs on why alter isnt supported](https://planetscale.com/docs/learn/handling-table-and-column-renames)

What this means is that we will need a structured way to handle schema changes
and migration scripts.

## Schema change workflow outline

1. Make schema change in codebase (add new column/table, remove old column)
2. Apply the migration manually to the dev database branch `npm run db:push`
3. Test the migration in the dev database (see if the column exists or is
   deleted)
4. If the new column exists and needs to be populated, create a script in the
   `migration-scripts` folder that populates the new column based on an old
   column
5. Check that the new column was populated correctly for different types of data
   (if applicable)
6. Create DB schema merge request to production DB in planetscale console
7. Run the migration script to populate a new column against the production
   database (if applicable)

## Notes

We probaly want to have all of our migration scripts in one place and in one
language to make things easier long term. We can decide if this means Rust or
TS.

Overall, this actually becomes a simple process if we imagine it as an add and a
delete that happen separately rather than an alteration taking place all at
once. Once this shift in mindset is clear, it becomes obvious how we would
arbitrarily change a column by just creating a new one, running some function on
each record to populate it once it is there, and then deleting the old one.

**Small caviat** - This process is only simple if we are not dealing with a
column that is a foreign key. If we are dealing with a foreign key, we will need
to be very careful about the order in which we do things. We will need to make
sure that the new column is populated before we delete the old one, and we will
need to make sure that the foreign key is not violated in the process. This is a
more complex process that will require more thought and care. The good part is
we have no real DB constraints here so missing references would not break the DB
altogether, althought they would then need to be dealt with in the UI which is
not ideal in the slightest.

## Best Practices

- Always add defautls to new columns and mark them as `NOT NULL` if possible
  (this makes the UI easier to reason about as this is transferred directly into
  the types being used to render stuff, so its nice to know it will be there)
- Always add indexes to new columns if they are going to be used in queries
  (this is a performance thing and good habit to be in)
- Always add a migration script to populate the new column if it is based on an
  old column (this makes it clear what is happening and why, and it also makes
  it easy to reason about the data and the changes that are happening to it)
