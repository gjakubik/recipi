# Recipi Value Proposition

In a world with ChatGPT, virtual reality, and the steadfast presence of the web
in our lives, the world is moving towards digitization. Having the information
that matters the most to you at your fingertips is more important than ever for
these new tools to be able to help you the most that they can.

Recipi aims to solve the problem of recipi aggregation and management, so that
all of your recipes can live in one place. Have a physical family recipe you
want to upload? Use Image recognition AI to snap a photo and upload it straight
to our system. Havea recipe from a food blog that you want to save? Use our web
ingestion engine to save that recipe straight to your account. See a recipe in a
YouTube video? Upload a copy of the recipe in the description and you will have
it saved in the same place forever!

Recipi makes it easy to organize and use these recipes. You can view them
without constant bombardment with ads, and organize them into "Menus" for your
meal planning or events. Generate shopping lists from any Menu with just a
click! We want to give our users extra features that make using their recipes
easier, and eliminating the effort to go from a craving to a bite with none of
the guilt of another overpriced meal delivery order.

As time moves forward and technology advances, Recipi is commited to integrating
with new technologies and being the to be the source of truth for all of our
users' cooking lives.
